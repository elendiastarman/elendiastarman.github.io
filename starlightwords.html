Low-quality materials are simply unable to resist great stresses (fire) but high-quality stuff endures. Connects with the Parable of the Talents - <span class="bible" ref="Matthew 25:29 (TPT)">Matthew 25:29 - "For the one who has will be given more, until he overflows with abundance. And the one with hardly anything, even what little he has will be taken from him."</span> Note though that even the builder who uses low-quality, perishable materials will still be saved from destruction.<br/><span class="divine" speaker="Yahweh">The worth of a person is not the worth of their work.</span><br/></li><li><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 3:9 (TPT)">v9 - "We are coworkers with God and you are God's cultivated garden, the house he is building."</span> At first glance it seemed to me like this was out of place since the surrounding verses seem more applicable to e.g. church building. It's about that <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">and</span> about the work we do with <span class="divine">God</span> on <span class="divine-underline underline" speaker="Y">ourselves</span>. We are as much a work in progress as the things we work on. <span class="divine">God</span> desires collaboration, that much is clear, but he won't settle for cheap [stuff], instead preferring growth that can and will endure the fires to come.<br/><span class="divine" speaker="Yahweh">Forest fires lead to new growth.</span></li>

          <p>Previously, the recognized dwelling place of <span class="divine">God</span> was the Holy of Holies, in the center of the Jewish temple where only one person was allowed to visit, and only infrequently, and only after a sacrifice.

          <p>Paul and Sosthenes, a former synagogue leader who was beaten publicly in a Roman courtroom for siding with Paul (<span class="bible" ref="Acts 18:17 (TPT)">Acts 18:17</span>), are jointly writing this letter to the Corinthians that listen to what they have to say.</p>

          <p>We are completely unable to persevere and do the <span class="divine">Lord's</span> work under our own power and strength. This is on purpose; it forces us to actually develop that intimacy with <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> in our relationships with Him. <span class="divine" speaker="Yahweh">That's the beauty of it!</span></p>

          <p>Intimate knowledge of and relationship with <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> and <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> is a <span class="divine" speaker="Yahweh">fountain-spring</span> of inspiration and riches - not the perishable sort that the world offers.

          <p>Paul's frustration here is that the Corinthians are spending time and energy arguing amonst themselves about whose teachings they believe and follow. In particular, I love this quip: <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 1:13 (TPT)">v13 - "Did I die on the cross for you?"</span> <span class="divine">Christ</span> was the sacrifice that brought the people closer to <span class="divine">God</span>. <span class="divine" speaker="Yeshua">It didn't have to be that way, but I chose it.</span> Paul, Apollos, and other preachers are "merely" vessels for <span class="divine">God</span> to connect with people that would otherwise probably miss Him.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 1:17a (TPT)">v17a - "For the Anointed One has sent me on a mission, not to see how many I could baptize, but to proclaim the Good News."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>The point isn't to accomplish some arbitrary metrics to show that you're doing work. The point is to <span class="divine-underline underline-bold" speaker="Yahweh">tell people</span> that they <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">can</span> have a relationship with <span class="divine">God</span>.

          <p>The exemplar here being <span class="divine">Christ's</span> sacrifice on the cross - the wisest men in the world have no hope of understanding this sacrifice and how it brings life to us. That is, unless their wisdom comes from <span class="divine">God</span>. To them, taking up one's cross is the way to destruction as it essentially means you're carrying your own method of execution with you.

          <p>This reminds me of that Scott Manley video on Youtube where he talked about his experience being a science consultant for a TV show (or movie?) about space. In particular, the writers wanted a specific ending, so they would tweak the story to overcome <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">solutions</span>, to various problems, that other people proposed. Whatever we humans could have or ever will think of as avenues to salvation and equality with <span class="divine">God</span> were fundamentally flawed from the very beginning. <span class="divine">God</span> designed the universe this way so that genuine relationship with <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> can only be a result of seeking Him <span class="divine-underline underline-bolder" speaker="Y">personally</span>. Reminds me of <span class="bible" ref="Psalm 37 (NIV)">Psalm 37</span> and <span class="bible" ref="Philippians 2:13 (TPT)">Phil 2:13 - "God will continually revitalize you, <span class="divine-underline underline-bold" speaker="Y">implanting</span> within you the passion to do what pleases Him."</span></p>

          <p>Prideful boasting - "look at me, I did it!" - stinks to <span class="divine">God</span> since at its root is a rejection of <span class="divine">God</span> as the all-sufficient Provider.

          <p>Paul didn't come to the Corinthians with persuasive arguments because he knew that if he succeeded - quite likely, given his background and education - then they would be trusting the power of his arguments and not the source of his faith. <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> is the Author of this world's Story and true faith lies in believing <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">Him</span> about the Story.

          <p>Here, Paul speaks of the kind of wisdom that only comes from <span class="divine">God</span>, in contrast to the world's wisdom.

Invert the Tabernacle.

          <p>The first thing that came to mind was the connection to speaking, praying, singing, or worshiping in the spirit.

So this speaks to me - it <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">is</span> true that, in some sense, praying "in the spirit" is more "honest" and real. And then it connects directly to the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> - the only Person who truly and fully knows and understands <span class="divine">God's</span> thoughts and desires. Technically, theologically-speaking, <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> does too because he too is <span class="divine">God</span>, but <span class="divine" speaker="Y">he chose to be led by the Spirit.</span></p>

          <p>Paul again emphasizes that relying on human wisdom is futile, and that <span class="divine">God's</span> wisdom is superior. I find that I am more drawn to these other verses at the beginning and end of this passage, about our relationship with each Person of <span class="divine">God</span>. The inner sanctuary of the Jewish Temple was revealed when the <span class="divine">Messiah</span> died on the cross.</p>

          <p>The immediate context is Paul saying that he doesn't care what anyone thinks of him (not even he himself) because <span class="divine">God</span> is the only/true Judge. This kind of thinking, and the way Paul expresses it, seems a bit off to me. In part because it's an attitude that I've had as well, and in my experience, it can be easy to dismiss judgemental (or not!) feedback from other people simply because that feedback came from another human and not a voice in my head (sometimes <span class="divine">God</span>, sometimes not). <span class="divine">God</span> speaks through other people sometimes, and the important <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">and</span> difficult bit is discerning which bits are from Him.</p>

          <p>Here Paul is reminding the Corinthians that what they do have, wealth, prestige, etc, was given to them. It is because of <span class="divine">God's</span> grace that they <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">do</span> and can have these things and enjoy them.

          <p>Paul is referring to himself and other apostles in this passage, talking about how they get no special treatment but instead get all kinds of mistreatment. Yet, even so, they follow the example of <span class="divine">Christ</span>, who also suffered a great deal of stigma and abuse. They - apostles, <span class="divine">Christ</span>, <span class="divine">Christ</span>-followers - respond to abuse with blessing to break the cycle and upend the "natural" (sinful/sin-full) order of things. The world is already full of misery; why add to it? They endure persecution and all kinds of suffering with patience because they have a Hope, something to look forward to.

          <p>The ancient equivalent of "you can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?". Paul wrote this to repudiate people among the Corinthians that had set themselves up as leaders of the church(es) there, especially in a way that assumed that they themselves were the main and/or sole authority leading and guiding the Church. Paul compares himself to a true father, who disciplines and corrects when necessary, and does so out of love. He compares the others to babysitters, who only tell you what you're doing wrong. So I'm seeing a two-fold lesson: it's not enough to simply tell people what they're doing wrong - you have to tell them what to do right <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">and</span> the proof that they should listen to you is that your words come with power. That power comes from the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span>, cf. <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 2:13b (TPT)">1 Cor 2:13b</span>, who also ensures that these words come from a place of love, not criticism.</p>

          <p>A small amount of yeast, even in a large dough, will spread throughout the bread and make it rise. By way of analogy, being tolerant of sin allows it to spread and multiply, and even a small amount can have an outsized impact. What I struggle to understand here is that this seems like a recipe for a purity spiral, where a group of people force out members that have been deemed insufficiently pure, with the end result that this group of people destroys itself. It also seems to me like we <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">are</span> generally encouraged to be tolerant of others, with a mind towards forbearance. Gracy and mercy and all that. The key in this passage, I think, is that the Corinthian church was aware of this particular sinful practice, and then were like "yeah this is fine". Unchecked, such attitudes are infectious. There is grace for people who make mistakes, and mercy for those who repent. But neither of those is license to sin. For the Jews, <span class="divine">Christ's</span> sacrifice is a direct fulfillment of the Law, but Gentiles had no such "Law of Moses and the Prophets". Instead, <span class="divine">Christ</span> dwells within everyone, Jews included, and helps(?) cleanse them of sin from the inside out. Don't make his sacrifice be in vain, but remember that it always has power.</p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 5:12-13 (TPT)">v12-13 - "What right do I have to pronounce judgment on unbelievers? That's God's responsibility. But those who are inside the church family are our responsibility to discern and judge. So it's your duty to remove that wicked one from among you."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>The context here being that we as believers cannot avoid associating with sinful unbelievers because then we'd have to leave the world entirely. Rather, this passage is about people who say they're believers and enjoy all the benefits of church family, but continue to live sinful lifestyles as if it was fine. The phrase that came to mind was <span class="other" speaker="spirit">"an enemy in the camp"</span> - sin from within can infect and spread through the church, especially because most attention is directed at external threats. So while sin outside the Church is the domain of <span class="divine">God</span> as the Final Judge, sin within the church is the responsibility of the leaders of that church. Hefty. Extending the idea, I am responsible for my own sin and not that of anyone else, and until and unless I have authority over other people and the responsibility that comes with it. E.g. as a parent, it would be my duty to warn, correct, and guide my children if I saw them struggling with sin. But for now, I am responsible for <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">me</span>.</p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 6:4-5 (TPT)">v4-5 - "Don't you realize that you are bringing your issues before civil judges appointed by people who have no standing within the church? What a shame that there is not one within the church who has the spirit of wisdom who could arbitrate these disputes and reconcile the offended parties!"</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Here, Paul criticizes believers within the church for taking their fellow believers to civil (worldly) court. Instead of taking their case to someone familiar with or endowed with Godly wisdom, they take it to judges with human wisdom. As has been the theme throughout, human wisdom is foolishness and <span class="divine-underline underline" speaker="Y">only wisdom from <span class="divine">God</span></span> is able to bring forth <span class="divine-underline underline" speaker="Y">true reconciliation</span>. As believers, we are part of a family that is set apart from this world and relying on worldly/Human mechanisms and institutions is denying implicitly/explicitly the Sovereignty of <span class="divine">God</span> and His role as our Master and Judge.

          <p>Paul precedes this with a list of sinful lifestyles, surely not exhaustive, that were probably emblematic of the sorts of issues that people in the church were experiencing. We have freedom in <span class="divine">Christ</span> as we are no longer bound as slaves to the Law, but we are subject to something higher and greater. We turn from what is legal to what is good. The Law can only, at best, be an approximation to <span class="divine">God's</span> guidance, and it is static, inflexible, and broad. In contrast, <span class="divine">God</span> is personal, always adapting, and intends to raise you up. And so, while we are free from the Law, we can still become enslaved to all kinds and forms of sin. The only true, lasting freedom comes from the <span class="divine">Messiah</span> (deliverer) and the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> (purifier) <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 6:11 (TPT)">(v11)</span>. Further, this freedom is backed by enough power to raise the dead, which is more than enough power for any issue we're struggling with.</p>

You don't belong to yourself any longer, for the gift of God, the Holy Spirit, lives inside your sanctuary."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Paul makes extensive use of metaphors involving marriage and sex here, specifically the aspects related to unity. (And expands on them more in the following chapter.) He emphasizes the difference between external sins, which harm others, and "internal" sins against yourself and your body. His main example is sexual immorality, but I think there are others like gluttony and self-neglect. Surely drinking 2L of coke and eating a dozen donuts every day is also a sin against one's own body! <span class="divine">Jesus</span> often healed people physically before addressing spiritual issues. One's own body is a vessel and vehicle for one's mind and spirit, and each part of a person affects the other parts. By mistreating your body, you are mistreating your spirit. And since our spirits are joined with the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span>, our treatment of ourselves has an impact on others as well. That's not the primary reason to take care of ourselves though - when we are unhealthy, we can't walk along the path <span class="divine">God</span> laid out for us. We have to stop, rest, and recuperate. But don't stay there.</p>

So don't continue to refuse your spouse those rights, except perhaps by mutual agreement for a specified time so that you can both be devoted to prayer."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>This passage is hard for me. I miss having physical intimacy with my wife and I despair and fear that I won't have it again. We do mutually agree to be apart for some time, but the end is not yet in sight. Doesn't help that my primary love language is physical touch. Also I don't know where she's at spiritually. <span class="divine" speaker="Y">She is in My care.</span> I feel lopsided.

          <p>This passage is essentially an elaboration on what <span class="divine">Jesus</span> said about divorce in <span class="bible" ref="Mark 10:1-12 (TPT)">Mark 10:1-12</span> -</p>

          <p>A union made under <span class="divine">God</span> has a role in His Story, and can accomplish more than the parts could by themselves.

          <p><span class="bible" ref="James 4:6 (TPT)">v6 - "But <span class="divine" speaker="Y">Yahweh</span> continues to pour out more and more grace upon us. For it says,<br/> &nbsp; 'God resists you when you are proud, <span class="other" speaker="spirit">in your own wisdom</span>, but continually pours out <span class="divine" speaker="Y">Grace</span> when you are humble, <span class="other" speaker="spirit">trusting in the Lord's wisdom.</span>'"</span></p>
          
        
          <p>After a shower, [my ex-wife] and I sorta slid into a conversation that turned serious. I think I handled it fairly well? I have to note though that <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> reminded me in the middle of what I've written before, in this very notebook, of His words - <span class="divine" speaker="Y">walk humbly</span>. I did my best to listen to <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> during the conversation, especially at what seemed like key moments. [My ex-wife] had two main points: be more forthcoming, and take initiative more often. She also expressed fear or concern about a few aspects of my behavior, such as my tendency to jump to action immediately when someone gives me a concrete idea/thing to do. I probably would've had a hard time with that conversation, but the <span class="divine" speaker="Y">Lord's grace</span> filled me and gave me strength and extra energy - and <span class="divine-underline underline" speaker="Y">peace</span> - to get through that and even now, try to record it in an honest way. Unflinching. I also noted verbally at the end that her points fit well with what <span class="divine-shadow" speaker="Y"><span class="me" speaker="me">Yahweh</span></span> has been saying. [My ex-wife] wants me to be more forthcoming - sharing information more readily and openly. It seems that I have anxiety that no matter the topic, she will respond or react negatively, like she's often done in conversations we've had. Also, seems to do it more often in conversations I initiate, which does confuse me, hence why I'm seeking the <span class="divine" speaker="Y">Lord's wisdom.</span> I feel like I am reasonably justified in thinking that I <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">do</span> take initiative and <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">am</span> forthcoming. I'm seeking the <span class="divine">Lord's</span> wisdom because there's a gap between my perception of reality and hers, and that gap has to be bridged <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">somehow</span>, and I feel like I could not possibly guess or figure out the right way to bridge that gap without seeking advice and teaching from <span class="divine"><span class="divine">Yahweh</span>, the Counselor.</span></p>
          
        
          <p> &nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="divine" speaker="Y">They are unsure of your motives.</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Lotta thoughts went through my head but essentially what they boil down to is that I see it as consistent motives that are expressed differently based on circumstance etc, whereas they just see a bunch of hidden variables interacting in complex ways. So by voicing my motives and attitudes more often, I could perhaps put them at ease. That brings me to my next point/hang-up: this feels unfair. It feels to me like both [my friend's caretaker] and [my ex-wife] have been pretty tight-lipped a lot. <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> reminds me that grace is not tit-for-tat. This is the sort of situation that only progresses if one side or the other is willing to take the first step. I belong to <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> and He commands me to <span class="divine" speaker="Y">take as many first steps as you need to.</span> <span class="divine">God's</span> wisdom is foolish by human standards, but it's really the other way around. <span class="divine" speaker="Y">770 times.</span> ...aand that connects with the other point of taking initiative.</p>

          <p>When I read <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 7:32 (TPT)">v32</span>, I had to pause for a moment because I was so surprised/amazed by the direct connection to the last words I wrote last night while praying - <span class="divine" speaker="Y">do not fear.</span> A footnote mentions that Paul may have written this during a great famine (AD 51), which would certainly explain the tone of urgency, both explicit (<span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 7:26 (TPT)">v26</span>, <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 7:29 (TPT)">v29</span>) and implicit (the whole passage). Naturally, Paul as a celibate man, advocates for remaining single as opposed to rushing to get married, but he makes good points that a married person cannot devote all their time and attention to <span class="divine">God</span>, since they would neglect their spouse, but a single person has no such restriction. Even so, a Marriage has a power and purpose that cannot be realized by single people. In the midst of turbulent times, one must focus on <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 7:35c (TPT)">"serving the Lord constantly with an undivided heart" (v35c)</span>, and that means different things for single people and married people.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="divine" speaker="Y">Reconcile. Serve in unity.</span></p>

          <p>The context here is actually about one's conscience as it relates to eating food that was offered to idols - an example of an act that is sinful for some (e.g. people that used to worship idols) and totally fine for others (e.g. people that know and understand that the gods represented by idols are powerless and nothing compared to <span class="divine">Yahweh</span>, the one real <span class="divine">God</span>). To someone like Paul, this offering is meaningless and so he can just eat the food. But for someone who used to live this kind of sinful lifestyle, seeing another believer doing this risks pulling them back into it. And, if they do, then the 'mature' believer has also sinned and everyone is worse off.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 8:13 (TPT)">v13 - "So I conclude that if my eating certain food deeply offends my brother and hinders his advance in Christ, I will never eat it again. I don't want to be guilty of causing my brother or sister to be wounded and defeated."</span></p>

So my response to fear here in this instance is to analyze it and break it down so I can <span class="divine" speaker="Y">rebuke</span> this spirit of <span class="divine-underline underline" speaker="Y">hesitancy</span>.</p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 9:12 (TPT)">v12 - "And if you have supported others, don't we rightfully deserve this privilege even more? But as you know, we haven't used that right. Instead, we have continued to support ourselves so that we would never be a hindrance to the spread of the gospel of Christ."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Paul reminds the Corinthians that they <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">have</span> supported people financially in the past, so if they were being consistent, they should also support the apostles. I wonder if this is also related to the disputes they were having over leadership (<span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 1:10-13 (TPT)">c1:v10-13</span>). And yet, Paul also explicitly states that he is not <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">expecting</span> financial support - if the spread of the gospel would be hindered by him getting his rightful compensation, then he would rather work for a living. That's where his priorities lie.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 9:11 (TPT)">v11 - "So, if we've sowed many spiritual gifts among you, is it too much to expect to reap material gifts from you?"</span><br/><span class="bible" ref="14a">14a - "In the same way, the Lord has directed those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Back to the idea of the Church as a body - every part is necessary and has different functions to perform. Parts that perform one essential function still need to be supported by others as they cannot fulfill all of their own needs.</p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 (TPT)">v16-18 - "Let joy be your continual feast. Make your life a prayer. And in the midst of everything be always giving thanks, for this is God's perfect plan for you in Christ Jesus."</span><br/><span class="bible" ref="1 Thessalonians 5:8 (TPT)">v8 - "But since we belong to the day, we must stay alert and clearheaded by placing the breastplate of faith and love over our hearts and a helmet of the hope of salvation over our thoughts."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Seeing lots of connections from this chapter to the themes I've seen and studied in the first several chapters of <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians (TPT)">1 Corinthians</span>, namely the reliance on <span class="divine">God's</span> wisdom as opposed to human wisdom.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Thessalonians 5:2 (TPT)">v2 - "For you already know quite well that the day of the Lord will come unexpectedly and as a complete surprise."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>And so, since we can't possibly predict when this would happen, we must follow what the <span class="divine">Lord</span> says to us. Fear doesn't do anything good for us; it just uses up time and distracts us from <span class="divine">God's</span> path. On the other hand, when we walk in joy, we assert that <span class="divine">Father</span> knows best and He cares for us. When we walk in prayer, our minds are set on the <span class="divine">Lord's</span> promises and trusting that He will see them through. When we walk in thanksgiving, we confirm that <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> is the Giver of all good things in life, and even in the troubles we go through, He is faithful and Good will result. He is the Victor.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="divine">Jesus</span> had a Triumph - a procession through a major city as people cheered and hailed him as a great Victor. What did He defeat? Death. When did He defeat it? After He died. This is nonsensical to us, but that's the way <span class="divine">God</span> works. In His Story, Death was already defeated and whether the people knew it or not, that's what they were celebrating.</p>

          <p><span class="divine">God</span> called Paul to go and preach, so Paul trusts Him to provide the resources he needs to live and work. I bought this house because I felt the <span class="divine">Lord's</span> call and I even have a sign that I made under inspiration that says <span class="divine" speaker="Y">"Steward of the House of Yahweh"</span>. I also stress about the (perceived) lack of financial support. I pay basically all the bills from my own income and I don't have much leftover.

          <p>This passage resonated so strongly with me that I suspect I internalized these ideas when I was much younger.

I've long thought that because winning people to <span class="divine">Christ</span> was the top priority, then I'll just shape-shift to whatever form is needed.

Paul's point is more apparent in <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 9:25b (TPT)">v25b - "But we run our race to win a victor's crown that will last forever."</span> The only way to victory is forward. Stepping off the track is defeat. So this is where discipline comes in - to stay focused on the prize and stay on the racetrack. The race that is life is naturally much more complicated than running 1600m around a flat oval, but the general principle still applies: victory - whether that is getting first place or finishing last - can only be achieved by running along the track.

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 10:17 (TPT)">v17 - "For although we're many, we become one loaf of bread and one body as we feast together on one loaf."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Paul is drawing parallels here between the practice of communion, where one loaf of bread and one cup of wine are shared among a group of believers, with similar practices by those who offer food to idols and then eat it. The difference is of course that the former is offered to the true living <span class="divine">God</span> while the latter is not. Paul makes the parallel pretty clear in <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 10:21">v21</span> - you can't do both. <span class="divine">God</span> doesn't want half-hearted obedience. If one is going to follow <span class="divine">God</span>, go all in. I picked out <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 10:17">v17</span> though because it extends the metaphor that <span class="divine">Jesus</span> used. When he taught communion to the disciples, he framed it in the context of sacrifice - his body (material substance) would be broken and his blood (life-giving fluid) would be spilled. Elsewhere, many references are made to the Church being the Body of <span class="divine">Christ</span> - the means by which He continues to move and operate within the world. When we <span class="divine">Christ</span>-followers join each other at the communion table, the ritual we perform is symbolic of this. When we eat together in the <span class="divine">Lord's</span> presence, we are community.</p>

          <p>This whole chapter consists of <span class="divine">Jesus</span> praying for his present and future disciples, right before he's betrayed in the Garden of Gethsemane. He knew that there was a lot of pain, suffering, and sorrow imminent, yet at this point in his prayer, he spoke of the transcendant joy that he had as a result of his relationship and unity with <span class="divine">God</span>, the <span class="divine">Father</span>. Moreover, he prayed that this joyous delight would be <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">fulfilled</span> - that is, be made real and manifest, and be made complete by <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">expressing</span> it - and that it would <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">overflow</span>, spreading like fire to the hearts and minds of those around them.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="other" speaker="prayer"><span class="divine">Father</span>, I pray that you would anoint me with this oil of joy that fills me and suffuses my whole being.

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 10:29 (TPT)">v29 - "I'm talking about someone else's conscience, not yours. What good is there in doing what you please if it's condemned by someone else?"</span></p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 10:31 (TPT)">v31 - "Whether you eat or drink, live your life in a way that glorifies and honors God."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>There is a tension here between personal liberty, which Paul once again emphasizes that he has, and interpersonal responsibility. Yes, we are free to do "whatever" we want, but if it conflicts with our mission and message, then what good is it? If you go to someone's house and they offer you food without saying anything else about it, it's fine, it's just food, go ahead and eat. But if they point out that it was sacrificed to idols, then accepting it indicates voluntary participation in this religious ritual, which would likely conflict with any message you have about <span class="divine">God</span>.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="23">23 - "You say, 'Under grace there are no rules and we're free to do anything we please.' Not exactly. Because not everything promotes growth in others. Your slogan, 'We're allowed to do anything we choose,' may be true - but not everything causes the spiritual advancement of others."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Personal freedom in private, social responsibility in public. What one does in private is between them and <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> but when among others, one has to consider their influence on them, especially with regard to one's mission and purpose.</p>

As one footnote mentions, "Before Pentecost, the woman was not seen as anyone with authority, but at Pentecost, the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> fell on [both] men and women" and the witnesses to the empty tomb and the risen <span class="divine">Jesus</span> were women. <span class="divine">God</span> is always ahead of us, more progressive than the culture of our times.</p>

          <p>If everyone is a pastor, who will feed the hungry? If everyone serves food, who will fight against injustice?

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 12:13 (TPT)">v13 - "For by one Spirit we all were immersed and mingled into one single body. And no matter our status - whether we are Jews or non-Jews, oppressed or free - we are all privileged to drink deeply of the same Holy Spirit."</span></p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 12:18 (TPT)">v18 - "But God has carefully designed each member and placed it in the body to function as He desires."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>This passage clearly stuck with me for a long time - much of it had a feeling of 'old familiarity'. I was almost straight up quoting these words when I did my study two days ago on the preceding verses. More and more I'm sensing encouragement to find and integrate into a community of believers so that this mutual sharing of support can happen. The same <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> infuses us all like the blood in our bodies, bringing oxygen and nutrients to every organ and cell to bring them life and vitality. An organ outside the body can be kept from dying by expensive medical intervention, but it isn't really alive unless it's performing its function within a body. <span class="divine">God</span> can (and has) keep my spirit from dying, but I'm not truly living if I'm not among His family.</p>

          <p>It's interesting to me that the problem-solution pair is (seemingly) mismatched. Why not remove the burden? How does water help with weariness from carrying a load? Over time, in the course of carrying a burden, that burden grows heavier while one's energy and strength are sapped. An oasis in the middle of a desert has water for refreshment and shade for rest. It is a respite from the hot sun and harsh, shifting sands all around. Here, one can put down their burdens for a moment and regain vitality and strength.</p>

          <p>Funny statement from the guy that called us to be His disciples and promised us that the world would mistreat us. :) All that <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">he</span> requires of us will be easy to bear because he's with us, helping carry our burdens. We continually find our rest in him.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 11:26 (TPT)">v26 - "Yes, Father, your plan delights your heart, as you've chosen this way to extend your kingdom - by giving it to those who have become like trusting children."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Like children who know that they don't know everything and have to rely on their parents. Perhaps not workable with human parents, but with <span class="divine">God</span>, it's the only way. The citizens of <span class="divine">God's</span> kingdom are those who call Him "<span class="divine">Father</span>".</p>

          <p>Paul is really hammering home the point that we as a Church <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">need</span> diversity in function and there's no shame in being more vulnerable or less prominent/visible. The body as a whole is affected by the condition of each of its parts. (Which I can certainly attest to!) The church as a whole isn't healthy if any of its members are sick, hurt, or otherwise not performing their function as designed by <span class="divine">God</span>. For someone in a leadership position, this means they need to keep careful watch over their brothers and sisters so that anyone who falls ill can be treated and restored to health.

          <p>I've tried to live this passage. Dunno how successful I've been but it feels like much of this is familiar in the sense that I've consciously tried to implement these principles. Love is concerned with the well-being of others. Love rejoices for good and eschews evil. Love is persistent and gentle. Kind and patient. It doesn't matter if someone has great powers for doing stuff - miracles, moving mountains, speaking all kinds of languages, whatever - if they're not doing it with the right motivation. Paul even goes so far to say that such a person is nothing, worthless. Love comes first, and only love has value. From it, from <span class="divine">God</span>, everything else flows.</p>

          <p>Until we see <span class="divine">God</span> face-to-face, faith (trusting <span class="divine">God</span>), hope (anticipating His works), and love (seeking good for others) are the three things that remain even as gifts of prophecy, tongues, and knowledge fade away. But love surpasses all these because pursuing Good for others is practically the quintessence of <span class="divine">God</span> - He who created the universe so that He could love us. Paul calls back to his metaphor of running a race to receive the victor's prize in <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 10:24-27 (TPT)">1 Cor 10:24-27</span> as he says that <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">Love</span> is the prize we're running for. Everything else is limited and temporary - love is boundless and eternal because <span class="divine">God</span> is Love. We are His people, His vessels for expressing this love - even though He is perfectly capable of expressing His love in any of a million myriad ways, He chose to involve us because that's how He loves <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">us</span>. Let me repeat that - <span class="divine">God</span> loves us by including us in His love for others. Love is fundamentally other-inclusive, <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">not</span> self-centered or even other-centered!</p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 14:6 (TPT)">v6 - "My dear friends, what good is it if I come to you always speaking in tongues? But if I come with a clear revelation from God, or with insight, or with a prophecy, or with a clear teaching, I can enrich you."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>The sense I get from the rest of the passage (or at least, the beginning) is that the Corinthians had an abundance of the gift of tongues but not so much a corresponding amount of interpretation (for the understanding of others) or prophecy. It's all well and good to have gifts of tongues, but their function is limited to building up oneself, unless someone else interprets it so the whole church can benefit. In contrast, prophecy can be understood immediately (whether in part or in whole) and so is a more useful/functional gift for the church. Paul lists four things that enrich the church:</p>
          
        
          <ol>
            <li>revelation - knowledge that could not have come from humans,<br/></li><li>insight - key ideas that greatly improve understanding of some topic or issue,<br/></li><li>prophecy - speaking of realities not yet realized, and<br/></li><li>teaching - imparting knowledge in a way that improves understanding.</li>
          </ol>
        
          <p>I initially had trouble thinking of ways to define these that were distinct from each other because they're all forms of communicating <span class="divine">God</span>-given concepts and ideas to the church to build them up and align them with <span class="divine">God's</span> plans. Speaking in tongues builds up the self; no less important but perhaps less appropriate in a church gathering.</p>
          
        
          <p> &nbsp; <span class="divine" speaker="Y">Both are important for edification and understanding.</span><br/> &nbsp; <span class="divine" speaker="Y">But neither can be neglected. Above all, <span class="divine-underline underline" speaker="Y">listen</span>.</span></p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 14:26 (TPT)">v26 - "Beloved friends, what does all this imply? When you conduct your meetings, you should always let everything be done to build up the church family. Whether you share a song of praise, a teaching, a divine revelation, or a tongue and interpretation, let each one contribute what strengthens others."</span></p>

          <p>I think these two verses encapsulate the main points that Paul was making in this passage - spiritual gifts are for building up others and the church, and expressing them shouldn't be chaotic and disorderly. I especially like how Paul says in <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 14:31-32 (TPT)">v31-32</span> that just because someone has the gift of prophecy doesn't mean they can't control themselves and wait their turn.</p>

          <p>Prophecy should be spoken out of love and with intent to produce Good, as directed by <span class="divine">Yahweh</span>. As per <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 13 (TPT)">1 Cor 13</span>, Love is above all, so all spiritual gifts, such as prophecy, should be subservient to love.</p>

          <p>Another instance where following <span class="divine">God's</span> wisdom seems foolish but it's the only way to success. Everyone dies eventually (with very few exceptions), so sooner or later, we will all be detached from our earthly possessions, including our bodies. Choosing to hold on to one's own life only delays the inevitable (if that) and sooner or later the effort will be wasted. However, if one instead decides to surrender their life to <span class="divine">God</span> and His plans, especially in the pursuit of spreading His 'Good News', the gospel, then the opposite happens. Not just life after death, but rather <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">continual</span> life.

          <p>The world was created full of life, including Adam and Eve. They made a choice that separated them from <span class="divine">God</span>, and so death became part of the world and in particular, became a defining aspect of humans. <span class="divine">Christ</span>, as the second Adam, consistently chose unity and cooperation with <span class="divine">Yahweh</span>. He died for "legal" reasons, but this also set him up to be the first person resurrected under the new paradigm. And now, resurrection life spreads from person to person, slowly but surely overwriting death and decay from Adam. Ultimately, at some unknown point in the future, the <span class="divine">Son</span> will eliminate Death entirely and present the whole world, His Kingdom, to His <span class="divine">Father</span> as a completed creation. <span class="bible" ref="2 Corinthians 5:17 (NIV)">The old has gone, the new has come!</span></p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 15:41 (TPT)">v41 - "There is the radiance of the sun and differing radiance for the moon and for the stars. Even the stars differ in their shining."</span></p>

          <p>Every human on earth began life with an earthly physical body. When that body dies though, that person may be "reborn" with a spiritual body/heavenly body like the one <span class="divine">Jesus</span> had after his resurrection. Much like a seed "dying", losing its original form, so that it can grow into something new and greater. And further, given Paul's metaphors in <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 15:37">v37</span> and others, you can't even necessarily predict what this spiritual form will look like based on the physical form, the seed. Everyone's new spiritual bodies will be quite unique and have their own sort of radiance. All that said, I also feel like this applies to the 'seed' of one's own soul/spirit. As in, we're born with a "seed spirit" that has to die, when we give up our earthly aims and ambitions and choose to follow <span class="divine">Yeshua</span>. When we die to ourselves, that's when <span class="divine">God</span> can start growing our spirit into what it ought to be/could be. Seed within a seed? Hmm.</p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 16:2a (TPT)">v2a - "Every Sunday, each of you make a generous offering by taking a portion of whatever God has blessed you with and place it in safekeeping."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Paul was asking for this offering specifically to support poor and needy people in Jerusalem, and he let them know in advance so he wouldn't have to ask for it when he arrived and only get what the church could afford/provide at that time. By asking in advance, each member could save up over time and thus provide a larger blessing for those in need. Also, note that we ought to give a <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">portion</span> of what <span class="divine">God</span> has <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">blessed</span> us with - if someone makes a lot, they should contribute a lot, and if someone barely gets by but has a few coins to spare, then that's what they should give. This is of course directly connected with <span class="bible" ref="Luke 21:1-4 (TPT)">Luke 21:1-4</span> where <span class="divine">Jesus</span> notices the widow giving a couple copper coins as her offering and remarks that she gave more - was more generous - than the wealthy patrons who tossed bags of coins into the box. I personally struggle with whether or not I should give tithes because I already put a substantial portion of my income towards people in need one way or another. At the moment, that's mostly paying the bills for a house of four, where I'm practically the only one with a job.</p>
          
        
          <p>12:41 - I had the idea of giving $20 every Sunday to a church and while I was anxious about the financial difficulty that could put me in, <span class="divine" speaker="Y">Yahweh said "you could do it".</span> I just got a phone call to let me know that the estimated cost for my upcoming wisdom tooth extraction in August dropped...by almost $20. Guess that $20 is gonna be an offering!</p>

          <p>A footnote says that this refers to <span class="bible" ref="Acts 19 (TPT)">Acts 19</span>, where Paul found a small group of believers in Ephesus and stayed there for two years. During this time, his teachings and <span class="divine">God's</span> miracles swayed a great many people, even to the point that multiple people burned a pile of occult material worth millions, and even high government officials loved him. A wealthy businessman incited a riot against him and it wasn't until after this event that Paul left and moved on to Macedonia and Greece.</p>
          
        
          <p>I have this sensation that the verse I quoted applies to me as well, as if it's something I'll find myself saying sometime in the next few months or years. I've often felt a calling to be a teacher, particularly of believers. I've said before that I think I'm meant to be a missionary to highly-educated people. Over the last several months I've had the idea of starting a VR church. There's a wole swath of people that are Internet citizens/denizens, and I wonder if traditional physical churches are really workable for them.</p>

          <p>In his final words of this letter, Paul basically sums up the whole letter and then urges them to honor and support people like Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus. He then passes on the greetings of Prisca, Aquila, the Ephesians, and finally himself, ending with a blessing. The emphasis here is on the community of believers, with them expressing their love and warmth towards one another. Especially in those times, with <span class="divine">Jesus</span> having died and risen just years or decades prior, they would have essentially been outcasts in their local communities so this sort of camaderie and mutual support was even more important. At the same time, Paul's exhortation in <span class="bible" ref="1 Corinthians 16:13-14 (TPT)">v13-14</span> also set them apart from the world and encourages them to remain believers with a purpose: show love and kindness to all. In other words, to show <span class="divine">God</span> and express His love among people who don't know Him yet.</p>
          
        
          <p>I'm reminded of the times during college when I just approached random people, listening to <span class="divine">God</span> to know which ones, and asked them if I could pray for them. Definitely nerve-wracking but at the same time, several of those people surely were impacted, maybe even encouraged, despite the troubles they were going through.</p>

          <p>Tangential note: there's ample evidence that high-ranking officials and wealthy people became Christian, not just the poor.

          <p>It's interesting to me here that <span class="divine">Jesus</span> being named <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> would fit just fine with the prophecy that he would be named <span class="divine">Emmanuel</span>. A person can have multiple names of course but here Matthew is listing two back-to-back. <span class="divine">God</span> became one of us to save his people from their sins. He became human and a Jew so that He could save Jews and Gentiles. The Jewish system of Law and atonement required a sacrifice, a penalty to be paid for sins, and so he was destined to die for them. But what about the Gentiles? They didn't have a system of Law, so the technical legal details of <span class="divine">Jesus</span>' sacrifice don't really matter here. Somehow I suspect the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> is involved - <span class="divine">Jesus</span> also lived His life as a human filled and directed by the <span class="divine">Spirit</span>, and it was after Pentecost, when the <span class="divine">Spirit</span> permanently filled the apostles, that the Gentile salvation began in earnest. Salvation of humans is by accepting the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> and voluntarily becoming a citizen of <span class="divine">Yeshua's</span> Kingdom, under <span class="divine">Yahweh</span>.</p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 2:6 (TPT)">v6 - "And you, little Bethlehem, are not insignificant among the clans of Judah, for out of you will emerge the Shepherd-King of my people Israel!"</span></p>
          
        
          <p>The Magi (wealthy priests of Persia) knew that the <span class="divine">Messiah</span> had been born in Israel, but not where specifically, so they went to Jerusalem, the capital, to ask. It was <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">Herod</span> that told them he'd been born in Bethlehem, after the Jewish priests and scholars told him. The 'star' they were following <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">reappeared</span> as they were traveling and led them to <span class="divine">Yeshua's</span> house. A foodnote mentions that there were almost certainly more than three people that traveled there, possibly even more than a hundred people that showed up at Mary and Joseph's doorstep. Imagine! And they all arrived with great joy and immediately worshipped <span class="divine">Yeshua</span>. The gifts they brought were immensely valuable and would later finance Mary, Joseph, and <span class="divine">Yeshua's</span> flight from Israel to Egypt. <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> sent these wealthy priests from Persia, guiding them by the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> to ensure that the parents of <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> could keep Him safe when Herod, the earthly king of Israel, sought to hunt down and kill this 'King of the Jews'. Supernatural help can come from the unlikeliest of sources and from people that one might not consider "followers of <span class="divine">God</span>".</p>

        <br/>Daily study on June 30 2021, 11:51 at office desk about <span class="bible" ref="Matthew 2:13-23">Matthew 2:13-23</span></h3>
        <div id="daily-study-2021-06-30_1151-contents">
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 2:23 (TPT)">v23 - "So [Joseph] settled his family in the village of Nazareth, fulfilling the prophecy that [Yeshua] would be known as the 'Branch'."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Three times in this passage, the 'Angel of the <span class="divine">Lord</span>' appears to Joseph in a dream in order to tell him to 1) flee to Egypt until Herod is dead, 2) return to Israel now that Herod is dead, and 3) avoid Judah because Herod's son Archelaus is the ruler there, and instead settle in Galilee, specifically Nazareth. So <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> is "from" Judah, Egypt, and Galilee. Actually kinda reminds me of how I lived in four different states in my early childhood. <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> didn't 'belong' to any one place. He was a citizen of Israel (Judah), a foreigner (Egypt), and an outcast (Nazareth, cf <span class="bible" ref="John 1:46 (TPT)">John 1:46</span>). This guy without an earthly home would one day reign over it all. His right to rule Israel comes via David but his right to rule Earth comes from <span class="divine">Yahweh</span>, and his lack of a single national identity reflects that. Also, naturally, the flight to Egypt parallels multiple Old Testament stories of Israelites going to/from Egypt for various reasons. Anyway, <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> made his home wherever <span class="divine">God</span> called him.</p>

        <div id="daily-study-2021-07-01_1240-contents">
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 3:11 (TPT)">v11 - "Those who repent I baptize with water, but there is coming a Man after me who is more powerful than I am. In fact, I'm not even worthy enough to pick up his sandals. He will submerge you into union with the Spirit of Holiness and with a raging fire!"</span></p>
          
        
          <p>John the Baptist, the last and greatest prophet of Israel, was baptizing people in water for their <ruby>forgiveness <rp>(</rp><rt>repentance</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> of sins, while telling them about <span class="divine">Yeshua</span>, who would baptize them in the fire of the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span>. And yet, something else happened when <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">he</span> was baptized.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 3:16 (TPT)">v16 - "And as Jesus rose up out of the water, the heavenly realm opened up over him and he saw the Holy Spirit descend out of the heavens and rest upon him in the form of a dove."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>The <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> came down not as flames of fire, like on the day of Pentecost, but as a dove of peace. As a footnote says, the implication is that the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> never left <span class="divine">Jesus</span>, in contrast to Old Testament times where the <span class="divine">Spirit</span> would temporarily come upon someone and cause them to prophesy.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 3:17 (TPT)">v17 - "Then suddenly the voice of the Father shouted from the sky, saying, 'This is the Son I love, and my greatest delight is in him.'"</span></p>
          
        
          <p>To cap it all off, a public affirmation from <span class="divine">God</span> Himself that <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> is His <span class="divine">Son</span>, that He loves him, and that He is delighted and overjoyed by him. I felt that joy when I was baptized.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="divine" speaker="Y">I love <span class="divine-underline underline" speaker="Y">you</span> too, don't forget. Yeshua dwells within you.</span></p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 4:4 (TPT)">v4 - "[Jesus] answered, 'The Scriptures say: / Bread alone will not satisfy, / but true life is found in every word, / which <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">constantly</span> goes forth from God's mouth.'"</span></p>
          
        
          <p>What stood out to me in this passage was that living on <span class="divine">God's</span> word is a continual act. Bread has to be made fresh every day (or rather, week) for it to be good and not spoil. A more direct comparison is manna, which <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">did</span> spoil after a day. <span class="divine" speaker="Y">Yahweh continues to speak</span> and every day's new Word is fresh and more beneficial to one's life than words spoken thousands of years ago. (Heretical, I know.) Even so, these old Words are still immensely valuable, but they are renewed and transformed by the <span class="divine">Spirit</span> inside us. When we listen to <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> day after day, the Words He speaks to us are what we need <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">that</span> day or <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">that</span> season. True life, not a simulacrum of it.</p>
          
        
          <p> &nbsp; But what does "true life" mean here?</p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 4:16 (TPT)">v16 - "You who spend your days shrouded in darkness<br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; can now say, 'We have seen a brilliant Light.'<br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; And those who live in the dark shadow land of death<br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; can now say, 'The Dawning Light arises on us.'"</span></p>

          <p>A footnote for <span class="bible" ref="Matthew 3:15">c3:v15</span> states that <span class="divine">Jesus</span> would have been about 30 years old at the time of his baptism. After this baptism, and after the trial of testing in the desert, he moved from Nazareth to Capernaum, right before calling his first disciples. Moved from his childhood home to a new place to begin his ministry. It is not lost on me that I moved to a new place just last year and I am now 29 years old. I've long felt that my ministry would be digital, on the Internet, and we're getting fiber at this house this fall. Anyway, what I noticed in <span class="bible" ref="Matthew 4:17">v17</span> is that there is again an implication of continual action - "keep turning". When you find that you're walking off the path, make an effort to get back on it, heading the right way. If/when you feel like you're way off course, trust <span class="divine">God</span> to lead you back.</p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 4:20 (TPT)">v20 - "Immediately they dropped their nets and left everything behind to follow Jesus."</span></p>
          
        
          <p><span class="divine">Jesus</span>, who was essentially an ordained minister by this point, was looking for disciples and decided to walk along the shores of the lake he lived next to. The four disciples he called in this passage were all fishermen, actively involved in working their trade to make a living. All four immediately dropped what they were doing and responded to <span class="divine">Jesus</span>' call. He promised to give them a higher and greater purpose, and that they would reapply their skills in catching fish to catching people, for <span class="divine">God</span>. There's some danger in extending the metaphor since fish are caught for food, but people caught and pulled out of darkness don't become food. Rather, they become <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">alive</span>. I'm not a fisherman, but the same principle applies:</p>

          <p>A footnote says that the word translated "taught" here is the Greek word 'didasko' - like 'didact' in English - which was often used for skilled training. That is, <span class="divine">Jesus</span> wasn't just preaching to an audience, he was training disciples. He preached about the kingdom realm and then backed it up with miracles. And not just any miracles, but <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">healings</span> - setting people free from mental illnesses, physical disabilities, and spiritual oppression. The "hope of <span class="divine">God's</span> kingdom realm" is freedom. Freedom from whatever holds you back from following and listening to <span class="divine">God</span>.

        <div id="daily-study-2021-07-06_1307-contents">
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:1-2 (TPT)">v1-2 - "One day Jesus saw a vast crowd of people gathering to hear him, so he went up the slope of a hill and sat down. With his followers and disciples spread over the hillside, Jesus began to teach them."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>What amuses me about the beginning is that <span class="bible" ref="Matthew 4:25 (TPT)">c4:v25</span> already says that massive crowds were following <span class="divine">Jesus</span> from a pretty broad area, basically almost all of Israel. This one day that a vast crowd of people gathered to hear <span class="divine">Jesus</span> wasn't that exceptional in size - maybe it was bigger than usual but it didn't show up out of nowhere. Nonetheless, the <span class="divine">Holy Spirit</span> prompted <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> to teach them a new "Law" from <span class="divine">Yahweh</span>, one that focus more on internal attitude than external actions, like the Law of Moses. Moses went up on a mountain to receive the Law of <span class="divine">God</span> for Israel and pass it to the people. <span class="divine">Jesus</span> went up on a hill to teach the heart of <span class="divine">God</span> for all, Gentiles included.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:3 (TPT)">v3 - "What wealth is offered to you when you feel your spiritual poverty!<br/> &nbsp; For there is no charge to enter the realm of heaven's kingdom."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Regardless of our material, worldly wealth, we have nothing, spiritually speaking. When we realize this fact, then heaven's kingdom is open to us. And then there's untold wealth for us within, and it costs us nothing to receive it. Unlike worldly wealth, where having much produces more, spiritual wealth is given to those that have nothing <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">and</span> realize it <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">and</span> admit it. We receive it not by our own effort but by <span class="divine">God's</span> grace.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:4 (TPT)">v4 - "What delight comes to you when you wait upon the Lord!<br/> &nbsp; For you will find what you long for."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>What's striking to me here is that waiting, a seemingly passive activity, has an active result of finding our heart's desire. Of course, the implication is that <span class="divine" speaker="Y">Yahweh is what we long for.</span> So when we wait upon Him instead of chasing after the next worldly prize or ambition, then we allow <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> the space to show up properly and have a genuine relationship with us as opposed to being just another thing that occupies our time and attention. And we are rewarded with His delight, properly expressed in us and to us.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:5 (TPT)">v5 - "What blessing comes to you when gentleness lives in you!<br/> &nbsp; For you will inherit the earth."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Again speaking against the normal ways of the world - you don't inherit the earth by being powerful and controlling vast amounts of territory and wealth, but instead by being gentle. That is, pretty much the opposite. Not by force but with cooperation. Not by being harsh but with kindness. There will one day be no place for people that push to get their way and disadvantage other people against their wishes. <span class="divine">Jesus</span> rode on a humble donkey in his Triumph, not a magnificent stallion like a conquerer. And yet, it's his kingdom that will endure after all others pass away.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:6 (TPT)">v6 - "How enriched you are when you crave righteousness!<br/> &nbsp; For you will be surrounded with fruitfulness."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Yet another pairing I wouldn't expect - why does seeking to be righteous result in abundant fruit? A fruit-bearing tree needs to have all the right conditions - enough water, nutrients, etc - and will be <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">more</span> fruitful if it's properly managed by a gardener that knows what they're doing.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="divine" speaker="Y">I am the Master Gardener. Learn from Me.</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Craving righteousness means having a mind- and heart-set that is focused on 'doing the right thing' - working to produce or realize Good for oneself and others around us. So by craving righteousness, one ends up producing good fruits in themselves and their environment, to the point of being surrounded by a great abundance.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:7 (TPT)">v7 - "How satisfied you are when you demonstrate tender mercy!<br/> &nbsp; For tender mercy will be demonstrated to you."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>This reminds me of the parable about the debtors/people that were in debt where the moral of the story was essentially that if you beg for your debt to be forgiven and then turn around and enforce a (smaller?) debt against someone else, then your eventual punishment will be all the more severe for abusing the mercy you received. Conversely, if you first show mercy, even at a cost to yourself, then your selfless attitude will be recognized and you will receive mercy yourself.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:8 (TPT)">v8 - "What bliss you experience when your heart is pure!<br/> &nbsp; For then your eyes will open to see more and more of God."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>From the footnotes, this could be rephrased as "Those whose hearts are full of innocence will progressively see <span class="divine">God</span>.". Sin blinds and distracts us from <span class="divine">God</span>, so as we root out sin from our hearts over the course of our lives, with <span class="divine">God's</span> help, then we will be able to see more of <span class="divine">God</span> and His movements in this world.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:9 (TPT)">v9 - "How blessed you are when you make peace!<br/> &nbsp; For then you will be recognized as a true child of God."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Continuing with the theme - people who seek peace and reconciliation show that they truly follow the <span class="divine">Father</span>. <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> longs to see His people and the world at peace. He desires us to work together and enjoy His company and that of others. Being human as a true child of the <span class="divine">Father</span> implies not only heritage and belonging, but also instruction and the alignment of goals and intentions. One of a father's primary purposes is to provide a good upbringing that aims to prepare their child(ren) to go out into the world and make it a better place. For us, that involves spreading peace and helping people reconcile.</p>

        <br/>Daily study on July 7 2021, 12:27 at office desk about <span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:10-16">Matthew 5:10-16</span></h3>
        <div id="daily-study-2021-07-07_1227-contents">
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:10 (TPT)">v10 - "How enriched you are when you bear the wounds of being persecuted for doing what is right! For that is when you experience the realm of heaven's kingdom."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Yet another unexpected pairing - why are wounds of persecution connected with experiencing heaven's kingdom? A footnote points to <span class="bible" ref="Acts 5:41 (TPT)">Acts 5:41</span> and <span class="bible" ref="1 Peter 3:14 (TPT)">1 Peter 3:14</span>, which clarify the idea in two different ways.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Acts 5:40-41 (TPT)">Acts 5:40-41 - "So [the council] brought the apostles back in and had them severely beaten. They ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus and then let them go. / The apostles left there rejoicing, thrilled that God had considered them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus."</span></p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="1 Peter 3:14a (TPT)">1 Peter 3:14a - "But even if you happen to suffer for doing what is right, you will have the joyful experience of the blessing of God."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>In the former example, the apostles were rejoicing because to them, the fact that they were beaten was a sign that they were doing something right. I.e. the Jewish council wouldn't be going to this much effort to deter them from preaching about <span class="divine">Jesus</span> if it wasn't a threat to their worldly system. In the latter, the point is that suffering for doing the right thing will be followed by joyful blessing from <span class="divine">God</span>. He doesn't expect us to toil and suffer indefinitely until we die and get to go to Heaven (although He could!) - <span class="divine" speaker="Y">Yahweh wants to reward us.</span></p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:11-12 (TPT)">v11-12 - "How ecstatic you can be when people insult and persecute you and speak all kinds of cruel lies about you because of your love for me! So leap for joy - since your heavenly reward is great. For you are being rejected the same way the prophets were before you."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Again, the promise of heavenly reward for being mistreated <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">because</span> of one's love for <span class="divine">Yeshua</span>. What stands out to me is the comparison with the Old Testament prophets. They loved <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> and spoke out because of it. Understandably, the people of Israel didn't like it when the prophets had to warn them of doom and judgment, but <span class="divine">God</span> gives that warning <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">so that</span> there was a chance for them to repent. Ninevah is an example where it worked, and Sodom and Gomorrah almost had a chance. If there had been even ten righteous people there, the cities would have escaped destruction. Instead, only a few escaped. Makes me wonder - is it inevitable that speakers for <span class="divine">God</span> have to eventually warn people of impending destruction? In any case, as said elsewhere, the world will hate us for breaking with the world and following something that seems utterly foolish. The Power Games continue as long as people keep playing and the ideas that <span class="divine">Jesus</span> preaches here are completely antithetical to them.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:13 (TPT)">v13 - "Your lives are like salt among the people. But if you, like salt, become bland, how can your 'saltiness' be restored? Flavorless salt is good for nothing and will be thrown out and trampled on by others."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Not sure I realized this before but it only takes a little salt to make something taste good. Almost like the 'good' version of yeast, except salt doesn't multiply and spread on its own. Anyway, keeping with the metaphor, that seems to imply that even just a few committed followers of <span class="divine">Yeshua</span> can do wonders for improving and preserving the communities around them. Don't think that just because you're so few that you can't have outsized positive effects.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:14-16 (TPT)">v14-16 - "Your lives light up the world. Let others see your light from a distance, for how can you hide a city that stands on a hilltop? And who would light a lamp and then hide it in an obscure place? Instead it's placed where everyone in the house can benefit from its light. So don't hide your light! Let it shine brightly before others, so that the commendable things you do will shine as light upon them, and then they will give their praise to your Father in heaven."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>This I aspire to. Like the Moon reflects the Sun, I want my words and actions to reflect my <span class="divine">Father</span>. His is the Light that dispels the darkness of our lives and our hearts. The added metaphor of a city on a hill that cannot be hidden implies that if someone does succeed in hiding their light, then that's effectively blowing it out. Instead, we're encouraged to let it shine, and <span class="divine-underline underline" speaker="Y">bright</span>.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="other" speaker="spirit">This <span class="divine-strikethrough" speaker="Y">little light</span> <span class="divine" speaker="Y">blazing bonfire</span> of mine, I'm gonna let it</span> <span class="divine" speaker="Y">SHINE!</span></p>

        <div id="daily-study-2021-07-08_1116-contents">
          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:17 (TPT)">v17 - "If you think I've come to set aside the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets, you're mistaken. I have come to fulfill and bring to perfection all that has been written."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>One thing that comes to mind is the fact that there would have been many Gentiles in the audience, but they lived in a world that was dominated - or at least, heavily influenced - by the Jewish legal system. They would generally have been familiar enough with the context and besides, <span class="divine">Jesus</span> <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">was</span> kinda preaching to the Jews. He didn't come to undo the old works; he came to finish them and start something new. I'm having some difficulty figuring out the intended time frame, so to speak. On the one hand, <span class="divine">Jesus</span> says that while heaven and earth are still around, the Law won't change. But he says in the same sentence, same breath even, <span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:18 (TPT)">"until its purpose is complete" (v18)</span>, which I would've assumed happened at the Cross. Similar mixed messages throughout, which makes me think that <span class="divine">Jesus</span> might only be referring to the Ten Commandments. Maybe I'm getting too caught up in the literal aspects. People who disobey <span class="divine">God</span> and teach others to do the same won't have much esteem in heaven's kingdom realm, but those that <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">do</span> obey <span class="divine">God</span> and teach others to obey Him will be highly esteemed. And here's the kicker - not even the religious experts are good enough. So the implication must be that it's not possible to truly obey <span class="divine">God</span> by following written laws only. Or conversely, simply following the Law to the best of one's ability isn't the same thing as following <span class="divine">God's</span> commandments and teaching their truths to others.</p>
          
        
          <p><span class="divine" speaker="Y">That's why it's so important to Listen to Me.</span></p>

          <p><span class="bible" ref="Matthew 5:23 (TPT)">v23 - "So then, if you are presenting a gift before the altar in the temple and suddenly you remember a quarrel you have with a fellow believer, leave your gift there in front of the altar and go at once to apologize with the one who is offended. Then, after you have reconciled, come to the altar and present your gift."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>One cannot truly worship <span class="divine">Yahweh</span> [with a gift of sacrifice] if one is holding anger or resentment in their heart, especially towards a fellow believer. The proper course of action is then to go and <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">reconcile</span> with that person, in line with <span class="divine">God's</span> heart, so that you can have a pure attitude when you return to the altar. Anger against someone in the same (spiritual) family is destructive and <span class="divine">God</span> isn't interested in letting anger or actual murder tear His family apart. The key aspect here is <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">why</span> one is angry. <span class="divine">Jesus</span> was certainly angry plenty of times, but it wasn't <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">personal</span>. <span class="divine">Jesus</span> wasn't angry at the money-changers in the temple courts because he had a vendetta against <span class="me-underline underline" speaker="me">those</span> particular people - rather, he was angry at them for exploiting and profiting off of worshippers that came to the temple for sacrifices. <span class="divine">Jesus</span> was angry at the injustice and once he had driven them out, he didn't pursue them further. Anger towards someone personally though has no range limit, so to speak. True anger at a particular person can only be satisfied by killing them, so <span class="divine">Jesus</span>' exhortation here is to do the opposite. Go reconcile with that person to get off that path to destruction. Go in peace and love.</p>

For you're better losing a part of your body than to have it all thrown into hell."</span></p>
          
        
          <p>Especially worth noting here is that Jewish culture of the time also thought of the right hand as "clean" and the left as "unclean", so not only is <span class="divine">Jesus</span> saying "cut off your good hand if it causes you to sin", which is applicable to all cultures through to today, he is also saying that supposed ritual cleanliness doesn't matter if one has sin in their heart. People can't get away with looking pure and righteous on the outside by following all the rules - <span class="divine">God</span> sees the inner motives of one's heart and judges based on that.</p>
